Project-Bikesharing
In this project, in this project I developed neural network model for bike sharing project. Working on this project I got better understanding of backpropagation and how neural networks work using Pytorch.
UCI Machine Learning Dataset is used int his project.
This dataset has the number of riders for each hour of each day from January 1 2011 to December 31 2012. The number of riders is split between casual and registered, summed up in the cnt column.
Looking at the data above, we also have information about temperature, humidity, and windspeed, all of these likely affecting the number of riders that I was trying to model with my multilayer neural network..
